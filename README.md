## Installation

To ensure a clean and isolated environment, we recommed using a virtual environment. Here's how you can set up the environment:

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**: Run the following command in your terminal to create a virtual environment named `venv`:

    ```
    python -m venv venv
    ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**: Activate the virtual environment using the appropriate command for your operating system:

    For macOS/Linux:

    ```
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

    For Windows:

    ```
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install Requirements**: Once the virtual environment is activated, install the project dependencies using pip:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
